PROJECT
-------

CL-URI-TEMPLATES aims to be a extensive Common-Lisp implementation
of the URI-Templates draft proposed to the W3C and already showing
increased use across the web.

It is currently developped by Thomas de Grivel <billitch@gmail.com>
at http://github.com/billitch/cl-uri-templates .


FORK
----

This package is a fork from uri-template written by Vladimir Sedach.

My goal is to contribute the missing operator parsers, and
further extend the URI deconstruction with these same operators.


PROGRESS
--------

Although operators are missing, variable substitution works fine
for interpolation and destructuring URIs.

Please report any bug you encounter, test cases and patches are also
highly appreciated.


REFERENCE
---------

This implementation is based on the URI-Templates draft proposed by
Joe Gregorio to the W3C. You can get it from the project page at
http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/

Vladimir Sedach, see http://common-lisp.net/project/uri-template/ .
